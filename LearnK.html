				<h2>Paid Resources</h2>
				<p>Learning can be a challenge for some, especially when it comes to languages since they can be so complex and different from what people are used to. Since people learn differently it would be best for you to look into what type of learner you are and what resources would benefit you most on your language learning journey, that includes budget as well since learning a language can be expensive sometimes. <br>The Learn! Korean with BTS book sets are a fun way to learn and are easy to follow for independent learners, however, they are quite pricey. The Talk to me in Korean (TTMIK) books have a good reputation for a clean and easy learning experience though I also thought they were on the more pricey side. I recommend the Billy Go! Books as they are pretty cheap and give lots of details. The price goes up quite a bit if you purchase the workbooks with them and while they are not needed to learn they are definitely very helpful and will provide a great way to memorize what you are learning instead of just reciting a textbook. <br> If you are having trouble memorizing Hangul (the Korean alphabet) I recommend purchasing the TTMIK Hangul Master book, you do not need any of the other TTMIK books to understand this book and it is very nicely structured. <br>Flashcards were also my best friend while learning, you can either buy physical flashcards, make your own, or download a flashcard app on your mobile device. My favorite Korean learning flashcard app is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flashcards.words.words">“Flashcards World”</a> and can be found on both Play Store and App Store. The great thing about this app is that it can translate to many different languages meaning you can use it as a learning resource for any subject, not just languages, and not just Korean.</p>
				<h2>Free Resources</h2>
				<p>Language learning can be expensive though it doesn’t have to be; there are many online resources for people ready to learn. I learn best by reading from a textbook and taking notes. If this is relatable for you, it may be hard to learn Korean since materials can be expensive, it is not impossible, however. notebooks are a great thing and even though they are usually relatively cheap, they can get pricey after some time. If you have access to a device that can run <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app">Microsoft OneNote</a>  I recommend downloading that and using it as your notes app, it is my favorite notebook app and can replace all of those expensive notebooks. If OneNote can not run on your device, Google Docs is another great option, though it has less options. I’m sure there are other note apps out there that are just as great, I am just not familiar with them.<br> A great free textbook replacement would be online PDF’s. There are websites where you can download the whole TTMIK books in PDF form for free and while it is probably not ethically right, it is okay if it is your only resource. The internet will be your best friend whether you are planning on spending money or not. The TTMIK website also has great learning recourses. Billy Go! Books were my personal favorite, the author often has live lessons on YouTube.</p>

<p>I also purchased Hangul and sentence flashcards off of Amazon and use both physical notebooks and Microsoft OneNote for my studies. My Korean Made Simple books were a gift from a supporting friend while everything else I purchased was under a grant given to me by my school. If you do not have the money for the textbooks and other resources you want, look into how to get the money to buy them, this includes starting fundraisers for yourself, looking at grant money, jobs, and even asking a friend for some help. I was very fortunate to find such great funding.<br> ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡  ♡</p>
